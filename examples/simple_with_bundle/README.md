### Sample npm app

This sample app shows how to use the `criteo-video-player` in an HTML file.
You will only need to import the bundled js and css inside your html file.

### Run

To avoid any cors issue, use a local server, for example http-server.
In the root of the projec, run

````
http-server .
```

Afterwards, navigate to the index.html in the current folder. You should be able to see the video playing.
